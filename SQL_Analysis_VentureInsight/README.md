**💼 SQL Analysis Project — VentureInsight**

**Project Overview:**
This project simulates real-world data analytics work for VentureInsight, a leading research firm that provides insights to venture capital firms and startup investors. The goal of the project is to explore and analyze a comprehensive database containing information about venture funds, startups, acquisitions, and key people in the industry.

Through a series of SQL analyses, I derived actionable insights that could support data-driven investment decisions and inform VentureInsight’s Quarterly Investment Report.

**🧠 Objectives:**

* Analyze the venture investment landscape using SQL.

* Identify funding trends, successful startups, and acquisition patterns.

* Generate insights on investor behavior and company growth.

* Strengthen SQL proficiency through complex queries and multi-table joins.

**📊 Database Overview:**

The database is designed to track relationships among startups, investors, and venture funds. The main tables include:

| Table             | Description                                                                |
