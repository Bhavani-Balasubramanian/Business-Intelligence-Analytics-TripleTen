ðŸ§© Task 10: Employee Education Impact on Startup Success

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

There is a debate about whether the educational background of startup employees correlates with company success.
Some argue that highly educated teams are more likely to succeed, while others suggest education has little impact.
This analysis focuses on failed startups (companies that closed after only one funding round) to examine the education levels of their employees.

ðŸ’¬ Interpretation

- The query calculates the average number of degrees per employee at startups that closed after a single funding round.
- Subquery logic:

    - Identify companies that closed and had only one funding round.
    - Find employees who worked at these companies and count their degrees.
    - Calculate the average across all employees in these failed startups.
 - The result, 1.23 degrees per employee, indicates that most employees at these startups had one degree on average.

ðŸª„ Insight

While employees had some formal education, a single degree per person suggests that education alone may not strongly correlate with startup success.

Other factors - such as experience, team dynamics, and market conditions - likely play a more decisive role in whether a startup succeeds or fails.
