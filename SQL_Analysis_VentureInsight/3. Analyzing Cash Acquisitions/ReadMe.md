ðŸ’¬ Interpretation

- The total value of cash-based acquisitions from 2011 to 2013 is approximately $137.76 billion.

- This indicates significant corporate activity funded by cash during the early years of post-recession recovery, suggesting companies had strong liquidity or access to capital.

ðŸª„ Insight

Cash acquisitions often reflect financial confidence and available liquidity in the market.
The high total value suggests that between 2011â€“2013, many companies preferred straightforward cash deals over stock-based acquisitions, showing renewed market stability after the recession.
