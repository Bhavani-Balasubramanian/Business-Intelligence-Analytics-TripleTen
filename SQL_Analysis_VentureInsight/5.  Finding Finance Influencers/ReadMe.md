🧩 Task 5: Finding Finance Influencers
🎯 Objective

After identifying broader industry influencers, the marketing team has narrowed their focus to finance-related influencers for an upcoming FinTech investment report.
They’re specifically interested in individuals who:

- Have “money” in their Twitter usernames, and
- Have last names starting with 'K'

This refined targeting helps ensure outreach aligns closely with the finance and investment community.
