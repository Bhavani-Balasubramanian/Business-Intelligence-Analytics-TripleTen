**🧮 Task 1 – Analyzing Startup Closure Rates**

**🎯 Objective**

Before beginning deeper analyses, the goal of this task was to understand the overall startup landscape in the VentureInsight database.
The executive team requested a snapshot of company statuses to determine how many startups have closed down, compared to those that are still operating or have been acquired.
This metric serves as a baseline for evaluating the success rate within the startup ecosystem.

**📊 Result**

| Metric           | Count     |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| Closed Companies | **2,584** |

**🧠 Interpretation**

The database shows that 2,584 startups have closed down.
This number highlights the competitive and high-risk nature of the startup world — where not all ventures reach sustainability or acquisition.
In future tasks, I will compare this with the number of operating and acquired companies to understand overall success ratios and investment effectiveness.
