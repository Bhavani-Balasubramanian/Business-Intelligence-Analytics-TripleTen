- The results are sorted in descending order of total funding, allowing quick identification of top investment destinations.
- The USA leads by a significant margin, attracting over $310 billion in venture capital.
- The United Kingdom (GBR) and China (CHN) follow as major players in global startup funding.
- A null country code indicates records where company registration data is missing.
