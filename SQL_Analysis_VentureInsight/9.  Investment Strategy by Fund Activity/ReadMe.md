ðŸ§© Task 9: Investment Strategy by Fund Activity

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Building on the fund activity classification, the research team wants to understand how fund strategies vary by activity level.
Specifically, the goal is to determine whether high-activity funds (investing in many companies) participate in more funding rounds per company compared to middle- or low-activity funds.
This analysis helps investors understand the breadth and depth of fund engagement across their portfolios.

ðŸ’¬ Interpretation

- - The query categorizes funds by activity level using a CASE statement, then calculates the average number of funding rounds per category using AVG().
  - ROUND() ensures the average is a whole number for easier interpretation.
  - Sorting in ascending order shows low-activity funds first and high-activity funds last, highlighting the increase in rounds as activity level rise
