## Part 1: Profits & Losses

In this section, I analyzed the SuperStore’s profitability to understand where the business is making money and where it is losing money.

I used a parameter-driven approach (Pair Selector) to analyze multiple combinations of dimensions such as Category–Region, Subcategory–Segment, and Ship Mode–Category. This allowed me to dynamically identify the two largest profit centers and the two biggest loss-makers across different business perspectives.

Focusing on the Category–Region view, the analysis shows that certain combinations (particularly in the West region) generate strong profits, while others—mainly in the Central region—consistently result in losses. This highlights that profitability issues are often region-specific rather than category-wide.

I also evaluated individual products to identify those with sustained negative profit and assessed product subcategories to recommend which ones the store should focus on and which should be phased out.

All conclusions in this section are supported by visual analysis.
