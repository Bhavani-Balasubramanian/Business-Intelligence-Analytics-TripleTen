# Saving SuperStore – Tableau Data Analytics Project 🏬📊

## Executive Summary

The **SuperStore** is facing declining profitability and potential bankruptcy. In this project, I act as a **data analytics consultant**, using visual analysis to identify where the business is making money, where it is losing money, and what strategic actions leadership should take to improve long-term profitability.

The analysis is structured as a **three-part consulting case study** covering:

1. Profit & loss drivers
2. Advertising effectiveness and ROI
3. Product and customer return behavior

Each business question is supported by **a dedicated visualization**, designed to clearly justify conclusions and recommendations.

## Business Objectives

* Identify the **largest profit centers and loss-makers** across the business
* Recommend **products and subcategories to discontinue or double down on**
* Evaluate whether **advertising investment is financially justified**
* Assess the impact of **returned items** on profitability and operational risk

---

## Dataset

This project uses the standard **SuperStore dataset**, consisting of:

* **Orders** – Order-level details including sales, profit, customer, product, geography, shipping mode, and order date
* **Returns** – Indicates whether an order was returned
